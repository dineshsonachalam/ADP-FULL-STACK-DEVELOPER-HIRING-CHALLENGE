I have calculated the kings rating using 'Elo rating system' based on win or loss and list all the attacker-defender kings and allies based on their rating.

### BACKEND


* Implemented a backend with Nodejs with Express.
* I have put the provided MySql Dump in the database.
* I am accessing this database from the backend.
* I have fetched all the data from the database ,and implemented the mentioned algorithm on that data.
* I have rendered output of the algorithm over the network in response to a REST call in JSON format.


### FRONTEND

* Implemented front end using HTML, BOOTSTRAP, JS.
* On every page load I have made a REST call to the above mentioned backend and fetched all the kings details.
* I have listed the kings based upon their rating
* When clicked on the king's name I have showed all the details of the king in the same page.
